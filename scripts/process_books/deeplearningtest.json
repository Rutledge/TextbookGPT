None of these projects has led to\u00a0a major success. One of the most famous such projects is Cyc (Lenat and Guha,\u00a01989). Cyc is an inference engine and a database of statements in a language\u00a0called CycL. These statements are entered by a staff of human supervisors. It is an\u00a0unwieldy process.

Its inference\u00a0engine detected an inconsistency in the story: it knew that people do not have\u00a0electrical parts, but because Fred was holding an electric razor, it believed the\u00a0entity \u201cFredWhileShaving\u201d contained electrical parts.
